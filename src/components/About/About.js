        <p className="about-text-1">
          I’m Josh Campanella and I make web applications in Portland, OR. I work with the React.js framework and I’m a JavaScript maven.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text-2">
          Bringing people’s ideas to life is my strength. My skills are particularly tailored to the building process – pixel-perfect development, implementing complex functionality, and providing a seamless user experience.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text-3">
          I pride myself on my attention to detail, my aptitude for figuring things out, and my reliable sense of accountability… and my CSS skills.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text-4">
          An unquenchable thirst for knowledge drives me, and I have an insatiable appetite for trying new things. In my free time I particularly enjoy gaming, motorcycles, fishing, and learning about web technologies and programming languages.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text-5">
          I did construction for 5 years as an independent contractor and learned first-hand the challenges that business owners face. That experience collaborating with customers and other business owners was invaluable in shaping me into the professional I am today.
