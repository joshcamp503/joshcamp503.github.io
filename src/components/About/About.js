        <p className="about-text-1">
        I’m a React developer living in Portland, OR and I pray at the altar of the holy web trinity… HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Hallelujah! (And if you’ve received a cover letter from me, you may have heard that joke before. Sorry!)  But all jokes aside, I am a serious student of all things web.  
        </p>

        <p className="about-text-2">
        I have been studying the holy three off and on as a hobby since about 2014 when my interest first sparked.  But about 2 years ago I got serious about making this a full-time gig, and here I am now.  I am fascinated by the power of the web & technology and how these forces will continue to shape society as we know it.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text-3">
        I can flex any box, await any fetch, and .then(manage any state). I’ve been working primarily with React.js and Javascript and I love how seamless and snappy a web application feels when it’s built on the React.js platform. But that being said, I’ve got the fundamentals and flexibility to quickly switch to a new framework if asked, or even a new language (looking at you, Python & Django).  
        </p>

        <p className="about-text-4">
        On the back end I’ve mostly worked with MongoDB and Node.js with Express, setting up APIs for my various projects. When I’m stuck on something, the first place I turn to is the documentation – MDN, reactjs.com, reactrouter.com, etc.  Sometimes I look to Stack Overflow for guidance, but I find that to be a mixed bag.  And lastly, I have a firm understanding of Git and Github – initializing repos, cloning repos, adds, commits, remotes, checking out branches, merging, etc. 
        </p>

        <p className="about-text-5">
        I’ve spent 4 years of my life working as an independent construction contractor.  I am productive, competent, accountable, and excellent at communicating and working with a team on complex projects with a lot of moving parts. I know how to put my head down and work, and if you’re looking to add someone to your team with a ton of technical talent and all the soft skills to go with it, give me a callback (pun intended), shoot me an email, or submit the contact form below.

        <p className="about-text-6">
          Looking forward to meeting you!
